# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Regression

This exercise is the combination of the following three topics:
-  Linear Regression
-  Cross Validation and Grid Search
-  Regularization (Lasso and Ridge Regression) and Gradient Descent 


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the crucial process 
At last, we completed a combined project which reflects all the above topics together. 
We chose Ames Housing Data which involves the lot area, all other amenities of the housing and corresponding sale price.
At the beginning, we do EDA to get initial idea about the data, then did some feature engineering to get the useful features before 
building the machine learning model. At last we evaluated our results by performing hypothesis testing.

## Discussion
After completing this exercise, I understand how we can build supervised machine learning linear regression model and in addtion we can find the utilization of Lasso and Ridge model to prevent from the overfitting problem.
